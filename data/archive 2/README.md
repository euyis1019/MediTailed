#  Overview
This is a dataset of blood cells photos.

 
There are 364 images across three classes: `WBC` (white blood cells), `RBC` (red blood cells), and `Platelets`. There are 4888 labels across 3 classes (and 0 null examples).



*`Fork`* this dataset (upper right hand corner) to receive the raw images, or (to save space) grab the 500x500 export.

# Use Cases

This is a small scale object detection dataset, commonly used to assess model performance. It's a first example of medical imaging capabilities.
This dataset is mainly preprocessed for YOLOV5 Application

# Using this Dataset

I'm releasing the data as public domain. Feel free to use it for any purpose.
`This dataset is already splitted into train,testing and validation datasets(70% for training , 20% testing and 10% for validation).` The train,testing and validation folders are further classified as `IMAGES AND LABELS.`
* `images` Folder : It contains images of blood cells.
* `labels` Folder : It conatins labelling of blood cells across three classes: `WBC` (white blood cells), `RBC` (red blood cells), and `Platelets`..
